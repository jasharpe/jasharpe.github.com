Need to figure out how to effectively offload work to display lists. Obviously the exact parameters of the shading could be tweaked as well. Also the nose is surrounded by this weird artifact.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It may be a little weird to get this to interact nicely with shadows.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Thursday November 18, 2:12 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve been playing with tricks to make rendering faster without having to resort to vertex shaders. I would try to use those, but only a small subset of the lab computers support them, and I&rsquo;d like to avoid using them if possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first obvious trick was to use a display list for the outline drawing - the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t already doing this shows why it&rsquo;s a good idea to sleep on things. It&#39;s worth noting now that when drawing for the purpose of shadow mapping, we can also use display lists since shading is unnecessary. (As I actually implement shadow mapping, this is an area that may turn out to be more complicated.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The second trick is to notice that with a fixed light source, we don&rsquo;t really need to rerender the lighting all the time, and in fact we only need to rerender the lighting for the primitives that move. This means that for anything not moving in the scene, we can use display lists to cache their lighting calculations. Each primitive is assigned its own unique display list to achieve this. (Note a potential tricky interaction with reflections however, as this effectively adds a second light source.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Taken together, these mean that in my final scene I won&rsquo;t be doing too many dynamic lighting calculations and staying in software for the cel shading computations should be feasible. Phew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(Bonus performance tip: the &ldquo;-O3&rdquo; compilation flag improves performance by about 3x.

Instead, every time I drew the vertex (a total of 4 times, usually) I would use a different face normal, which caused discontinuity in shading for obvious reasons. Unfortunately this adds a second or so to the startup time (as it computes each vertex normal - this would be horrific to do at every render), but it&rsquo;s not too bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The results are gorgeous:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="452.0" src="images/image2.png" width="381.0"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">4:45 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And the final (for now) saxophone, with flaring:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="482.0" src="images/image11.png" width="395.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I side-benefit of the aliasing work I did.

It&rsquo;s difficult to debug the transformation from light coordinates to camera coordinates, it suffers from extensive precision errors without careful parameter caressing, and even once it is set up fairly nicely, it is still disgustingly aliased for all but the narrowest light sources. Took around two days to implement to a reasonable state, a lot of which was spent frustrated and trying to figure out debugging techniques.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although my implementation is based on previous work by others, I had to add make the enhancement of using multiple textures to support cel shading and shadows at the same time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here is a simple scene with no shadows:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image25.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here is the same scene with shadow mapping and the light having a wide field of view (but not ridiculously so):</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image26.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Notice how the shadow of the saxophone plays across the rounded figure of the player (on the chest, leg and arm). Notice also how terrible the aliasing and artifacting is everywhere, especially on the chest and ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is a visualization of the depth map (from the point of view of the light) used to achieve the above effect:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image3.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can see that the player covers a very small section of the depth map, hence why the aliasing is bad. (Notice also that the orientation of this texture is of no consequence, since it&rsquo;s compensated by the light&rsquo;s viewing matrix.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here is the scene with a significantly narrower (and kind of impractical for actual use) field of view:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image5.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Notice the artifaces and aliasing are significantly reduced. The light&rsquo;s depth map, and the relative size of the player in it, shows why this is true:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image8.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A trivial solution to this aliasing problem would of course to use multiple, small depth maps from the light source. Unfortunately, this is not computationally feasible in my model. I&rsquo;m already pushing it adding shadows at all, given that my cel shading is done in software.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Wednesday November 24, 4:26 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m working on efficiency today since I&rsquo;m getting kind of worried about my 50 - 70 ms render times with shadows enabled and still very simple models. I was having trouble a while ago getting cel shading to work inside display lists, but I finally figured out that it was because I was requesting the MODELVIEW matrix (with which to do manual transformations) after performing a rotation inside the display list. Since none of the transformations are applied to the actual matrices when compiling display lists, this resulted in the wrong matrix being retrieved.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Preliminary results show that display list use for my spheres drops render time by 20 ms with shadows on. Because of the nature of my lighting, I&rsquo;ll have to recalculate the display lists when spheres are rotated or moved, but this should greatly improve my render times assuming most objects are static.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">5:05 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That was a surprisingly quick refactor, and actually made the code for both the spheres and the meshes much simpler. When not moving a ridiculous number of things at once, render time is now significantly faster.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">8:29 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve been reading up on vertex shaders, and decided that it wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to create a vertex shader to replicate the work I&rsquo;m currently doing in software to compute the 1D texture coordinates of the lighting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the course of trying this, I had to log on to one of the machines that supports shaders. Wow! This machine is so much faster than the other I was using. I&rsquo;m literally getting &lt; 0, 1 and 2 ms render times for most renders, and &gt; 70 fps even for frames with heavy in-software lighting calculations. I think I&rsquo;ll reprioritize the shader work behind some of the more directly objective-based work since I don&rsquo;t think I need the speed as much as I thought I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">9:36 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just spent half an hour solving a really stupid bug that ended up being caused by me binding a texture 10 lines too late.

Made a lot of little stupid mistakes that made this take longer than it should have, mainly because I am now dealing with three textures simultaneously (one for shadows, one for lighting, and now one </span><span class="c1 c7">actual</span><span class="c1"> texture for texture mapping), and keeping them all straight is a bit complicated. If I had realized how much texturing there would be from the start, I could probably have kept things much more organized.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example, for multitexturing you have to keep switching between the various different texture modes, and it would have made my life much easier if I had required that every block of code dealing with a particular texture mode needed to explicitly switch into that mode (with a single texture, you can just assume you&rsquo;re always in the right mode, so it seemed okay not to be explicit about this at first).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In any case, the result is cool:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image20.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(This is just some crappy texture I drew for demonstration purposes.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Friday November 26, 8:53 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sweet.

They are specified in a file like this:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="504.0" src="images/image15.png" width="668.0"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">where the first line is the length of the script in milliseconds, and each subsequent line represents a smooth motion of the camera between two different rotations (expressed in quaternions) and two different positions. This could be extended a bit to allow for selection of start and end easing functions for each motion (this would allow for nice circular motion, for example).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">6:38 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just completed the addition of translational animations, specified in the Lua file. They were straightforward if tedious to add, due to a new parameter of time needing to be pushed through all walk_gl and shoot_particle calls (since the position of models is now a function of time). I had an issue where I forgot to all translate the origins of particle emitters when particles were created, but this was easy to fix.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a proof of concept, my character is now levitating up and down constantly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now, the part that really matter (it&rsquo;s possible I won&rsquo;t even use translation animations in my final product unless I attempt walking): joint animations. Hopefully not too much more difficult, although I may run into problems since I&rsquo;m going to be interpolating Euler rotations, which can get nasty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">7:53 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Completed implementing joint rotation animations. It&rsquo;s not difficult to do, the only question will be if the Euler rotations are expressive (and predictable) enough to accomplish the animations I want. Most of my animations I anticipate being one dimensional joint rotations, so I should be more or less fine. So far I have my model raising and lowering his arms, and raising and lowering his head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I mentioned somewhere earlier that recalculating the cel shaded lighting was expensive, and that it would have to be done whenever objects rotated or moved in the scene. It turns out that I can choose to only recalculate the lighting every 20 or so frames, and it still looks fine. This is a huge increase in speed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Sunday December 5, 2:56 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m making a piano:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image23.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">4:56 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The band begins to emerge:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image16.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Question is, do I have time now to add a drum and/or a bass? The first is probably not too bad with a bunch of cylinders (although orienting them in a believable way seems tricky). The second would probably require a fairly complicated script to generate, so I may skip it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Monday December 6, 3:06 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve been working feverishly since about 10 this morning (after leaving the lab last night at 11!), breaking to go to class and have lunch. There is one new character in the scene, the one person who isn&rsquo;t allowed to abandon the concert because it&rsquo;s a 25 second perpetual loop - the bartender:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image21.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon he&rsquo;ll have smoke coming from his cigarette.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The club has become much more complete with the addition of furniture of various types (and a texture mapped liquor cabinet with my beautifully drawn texture):</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image0.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The floor has also been changed to look less like sand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The end is in sight (and thank god, because look at those frame rates!). Now the final touches - cigarette smoke and animations that respond to how well the player is doing (by going slower as the player gets worse). Although now that I think about it, I want to redo the camera script so that it is less stomach churning - also I forgot quaternion normalization in my implementation. Augh details!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">4:16 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Smoke is now happening. Cel shaded circular smoke to be precise. The bartender bops his head around with the music, making the smoke take on a nice pattern:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="565.0" src="images/image10.png" width="520.0"></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">5:03 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Fixed normalization of quaternions. Hopefully this should fix the egregious perspective distortion that occurs on some extreme camera motions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The final technological hurdle: animations that respond to how well the player is doing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">10:03 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The player and the bartender&rsquo;s animation now grow slower as the player misses notes, and stop if the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;score&rdquo; (a number than ranges from 0 to 20) reaches 0. Start playing again, and the scene comes back to life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As one of my final acts, I finally stamped out a bug that seemingly occurred randomly, and manifested itself as an OpenGL error 0x502 (invalid operation). Forgot to initialize an int representing a texture to 0. Oops! Moral of the story - check for OpenGL errors (not that they make it easy - in the end, instead of manually checking for errors after every operation, I just sprinkled checks semi-randomly throughout my code, and tracked down problems more precisely as they occurred).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And with that, I&rsquo;m done! The game is now in a presentable form. Obviously some tweaks could still be made, but as of right now I&rsquo;ve basically fulfilled the vision that I set out to create 3 weeks ago.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now to practice the demo tomorrow and do the real demo on Wednesday. (Also still need to write documentation!)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Tuesday, December 7, 3:56 PM</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Spent the day writing documentation (and to my shame doing some last minute code reorganization and fixes) and handed in the project.
